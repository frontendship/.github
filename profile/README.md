* To use Git, to be able to work in a team, to prepare new people in the field for their first work experience by transferring the use and objectives of the tools widely used in the ecosystem and to create a development environment very close to the **real work experience**.
* To be able to **ask questions or answer questions** to help everyone determine and improve their level.
* Organizing **face-to-face and online events** and trying to interact with different communities.
